## Modification

The Neopets Metaverse project is not authorized to use this software in any way, nor is any commercial crypto/NFT project, including under the terms of the commercial trial period below. If this is unwittingly violated, the expected remediation is to cease and desist all sales of crypto/NFT products derived from this service, in addition to offering appropriate compensation.

## Purpose

This license allows you to use and share this software for noncommercial purposes for free and to try this software for commercial purposes for thirty days.

## Agreement

In order to receive this license, you have to agree to its rules. Those rules are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license. Don't do anything with this software that triggers a rule you can't or won't follow.

## Notices

Make sure everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license and the contributor and source code lines above.

## Commercial Trial

Limit your use of this software for commercial purposes to a thirty-day trial period. If you use this software for work, your company gets one trial period for all personnel, not one trial per person.

## Contributions Back

Developing feedback, changes, or additions that you contribute back to the contributor on the terms of a standardized public software license such as [the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0), [the Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), [the MIT license](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html), or [the two-clause BSD license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html) doesn't count as use for a commercial purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, doesn't count as use for a commercial purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution doesn't count as use for a commercial purpose regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.

## Defense

Don't make any legal claim against anyone accusing this software, with or without changes, alone or with other technology, of infringing any patent.

## Copyright

The contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe their copyright in it.

## Patent

The contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patents they can license or become able to license.

## Reliability

The contributor can't revoke this license.

## Excuse

You're excused for unknowingly breaking [Notices](#notices) if you take all practical steps to comply within thirty days of learning you broke the rule.

## No Liability

**_As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the contributor won't be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim._**

# Additional Notes

The notes below are supplemental information, and are not part of the license agreement.

## Rationale

We absolutely want to support community projects and individual learning, and this license is designed to be very permissive for those cases! But our relationship with companies is different, and we'd like to have those conversations directly, rather than with a license document.

We recognize this license isn't compatible with common open-source licenses: you can't use our work and then license the derived work for commercial use, for example. But we expect that this won't be a problem for most people who are using this for personal hobby projects, or just reading along for general educational value!

## Alternatives

If this license doesn't cover your use case, please contact us at matchu@openneo.net, and we can figure something out!
