  Hello, hello! I'm Matchu, loving father of Dress to Impress.
</p>

<p>
  I just wanted to let you know how much your help means to me.
  I built the site mostly for fun, and never really expected it to catch on,
  but here we are, years later, and the site is entirely community-driven, from
  our modeling data to our hosting costs.
  Thanks so much for being a part of that community—the whole thing blows my
  mind, and I feel honored to be a part of this big thing that is Dress to
  Impress :)
</p>

<p>
  Before I forget, let's get to receipt business.
  You donated
  <strong><%= number_to_currency @donation.amount / 100.0 %></strong>
  (thanks again, by the way!),
  and you can update the name and outfits on that donation whenever you like at
  <%= link_to donation_url(@donation), donation_url(@donation) %>.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway. I hope you enjoy our little thank-you gift (you <em>do</em> have some
  beautiful outfits for me to show off, right?), and that Dress to Impress
  continues to bring you joy :)
</p>

<p>
  Oh! And, if you ever have anything to say to me, <em>please</em> let me know
  at <%= mail_to 'matchu@openneo.net' %>. I'm looking forward to any and all
  questions, comments, concerns, insults, treasure maps, love letters, memes,
  or limericks you send my way :D
</p>

<p>
  Thanks again for your help! DTI &lt;3s you.<br />

  P.S. Seriously. Reply to this email and tell me something.
  It'll make my day :D
