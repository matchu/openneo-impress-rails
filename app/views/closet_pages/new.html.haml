  **Welcome to the bulk closet importer!** We're going to make it as
  easy as possible to import your Neopets.com closet data into your Dress to
  Impress closet. Here's how it works.

  1. Check the framed Neopets.com window on the left, pointing to
    [page #{@closet_page.index} of your closet][cp].
      * **Log in if you haven't already.** If you're logged into
        Neopets, but not in this frame, enable "third-party cookies" in your
        browser. (Most have that on by default.)
      * **Confirm that the page is, in fact, your closet.** Don't just trust a
        website when they tell you to copy-paste the source code of another site.
        Instead, check that the page is what it is supposed to be and does not
        contain any information you didn't mean to give out.

  2. View the frame's source code.
      * **In Google Chrome,** right-click the frame and choose **View Frame Source**.
      * **In Firefox,** right-click the frame, choose **This Frame**, then **View Frame Source**.
      * In other browsers, right-click, and look for something similar. If you're
        still having trouble, try
        #{link_to "viewing the page in a new window", @closet_page.url, :target => "_blank"},
        right-clicking, and choosing View Source.

  3. Highlight the entire source code, and copy-paste it into the box on the right.
      * Some nifty shortcuts: Ctrl-A to select all the text, Ctrl-C to copy it,
        Ctrl-V to paste it in.

  4. Submit!
      * We'll analyze the code you sent us, grab exclusively the identity and
        quantity of items in your closet, and add that to your Dress to Impress
        closet. I promise it's all safe, but, if you're concerned, find a
        programmer buddy and [check out the source code to be sure][source].
