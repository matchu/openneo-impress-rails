- title 'Report broken image'

%p
  Thanks for helping us find broken image! Sometimes the converters don't get
  things quite right, and sometimes that can be fixed by just trying the
  conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to solve the issue, consider
  sending us a bug report at #{mail_to 'webmaster@openneo.net'}. Thanks!

  Which of these images looked broken? We'll put it in line for reconversion.

  - @swf_assets.each do |swf_asset|
    %li
      = link_to image_tag(swf_asset.image_url([150, 150])), swf_asset.url
      - unless swf_asset.image_pending_repair?
        = form_tag(:action => :create) do
          = hidden_field_tag 'swf_asset_remote_id', swf_asset.remote_id
          = hidden_field_tag 'swf_asset_type', swf_asset.type
          = submit_tag 'Report as broken'
