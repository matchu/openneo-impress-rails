    **Hooray!** We made our fundraising goal, and now have enough funds to run
    on the upgraded server for the next year. I'm pretty darn excited about all
    this.

    The server upgrade went through around 9PM NST on August 4, and the SWF
    converters are now running. We'll let them work for a bit until almost all
    of the SWFs are converted, then we'll release Image Mode to the public.

    Thanks again for all your help. Dress to Impress runs on you, from our data
    to our funds. You make this site the great resource that it is, and I'm
    consistently impressed by this community's generosity. Thanks for all you
    do!
