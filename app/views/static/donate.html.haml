#image-mode-description
  :markdown
    **Soon, Dress to Impress will be able to both save outfits as images and
    even run entirely without Flash**. Image Mode. It's taken months to put
    together, and it's pretty darn exciting. It's the most requested feature
    for Dress to Impress, ever.

    **To get there, though, we need a server upgrade.** We've done our best to
    cut back on memory usage on the server we have now, but ultimately found
    that, when we run the processes that convert the Flash files to images, we
    lose stability, and the site goes down.

    **So, we're moving from about $20 to $30 a month.** We'll be moving from
    [Linode's 512 server to the 768 server](http://linode.com). It's what we
    need to do in order to have enough RAM to both convert Flash to image and
    also run a website with thousands of users a day.

    **As a little treat, those who give at least $5 will get early access
    to Image Mode.** Though we're still missing quite a few converted SWFs,
    you'll be able to get a feel for what Image Mode will be when it's ready
    for prime time, and help make sure it's exactly as simple and powerful as
    it needs to be.

    **Thank you for your continued support.** Dress to Impress is 100%
    user-funded, and we hope to stay that way. Our goal is to raise enough
    money to guarantee that we'll be up and running for the next 12 months. I
    know we can do it.
