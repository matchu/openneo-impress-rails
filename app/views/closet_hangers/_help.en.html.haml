    **These are your items! You can track what items you want and own, and
    share [this page](#{request.fullpath}) with the world**. Just look up an
    item in the search form above to get started.

    **You can also sort your items into lists.**
    [Building an Up For Trade list is a good place to start][uft]. You can
    make lists for trade items with different market values, a private list of
    what you need for that next outfit, or whatever you like. You can also
    drag-and-drop items in and out of lists. It's pretty fun.

    **Your items also have privacy settings.**
    Items can be **private**, so only you can see them. They can be **public**,
    so you can share this page with friends. They can even be **trading**,
    meaning that we'll mention on the item's [Infinite Closet][ic] page that
    you own or want that item.

    **We try to make trading easy.** If there's some item you want, you can
    pull up that item's [Infinite Closet][ic] page to see if anyone is offering
    it, and see what *that* user wants
    in exchange. It's all pretty spiffy. Also, if you plan to trade, your should
    <span class="edit-contact-link">add your Neopets username</span> so that
    when other users come here they know how to contact you.

    **Have fun!**
