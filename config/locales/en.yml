      explanation_html:
        Thanks for helping us find broken images! Sometimes the converters
        don't get things quite right, and sometimes that can be fixed by just
        trying the conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to solve the
        issue, consider sending us a bug report at %{contact_link}. Thanks!
      call_to_action:
        Which of these images looked broken?
        We'll put it in line for reconversion.
      submit: Report as broken
