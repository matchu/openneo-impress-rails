      explanation_html:
        Thanks for helping us find broken images! Sometimes the converters
        don't get things quite right, and sometimes that can be fixed by just
        trying the conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to solve the
        issue, consider sending us a bug report at %{contact_link}. Thanks!

        intro:
          We're going to make it as easy as possible to import your Neopets.com
          %{name} data into your Dress to Impress items list. Here's how it
          works.
        check_frame:
          header_html:
            Check the framed Neopets.com window on the left,
            pointing to %{page_link}.
          page_link_content:
            page %{index} of your %{name}
          check_login:
            summary: Confirm that you're logged in.
            details:
              If you're logged into Neopets, but the above frame says that
              you're not, try enabling "third-party cookies" in your browser.
              (Most have that on by default.)
          login:
            summary_html: If you haven't logged in, %{login_link}.
            summary_login_link_content: do so in another window
            details_html:
              It's never a good idea to log in inside of a frame, unless you're
              a web programmer pro who can check that the frame does, in fact,
              point to Neopets.com. To be safe, %{login_link}.
            details_login_link_content:
              pull up another window, check the URL, and log in safely
          check_content:
            summary: Confirm that the page is, in fact, your %{name}.
            details:
              Don't just trust a website when they tell you to copy-paste the
              source code of another site. Instead, check that the page is what
              it is supposed to be and doesn't contain any private information.
        view_source:
          header: View the frame's source code.
          chrome_html:
            <strong>In Google Chrome</strong>, right-click the frame and choose
            <strong>View Frame Source</strong>.

            <strong>In Firefox</strong>, right-click the frame, choose
            <strong>This Frame</strong>, then <strong>View Frame
            Source</strong>.
          other_html:
            In other browsers, right-click and look for something similar.
          troubleshooting_html:
            If you're still having trouble, try %{page_link}, right-clicking,
            and choosing View Source.
          troubleshooting_page_link_content: opening the page in a new window
        copy_source:
          header:

          description:
            We'll analyze the code you sent us, grab exclusively the identity
            and quantity of items in your %{name}, and add that to your Dress
            to Impress items list. I promise it's all safe, but, if you're
            concerned, find a programmer buddy and check out the source code to
            be sure.
