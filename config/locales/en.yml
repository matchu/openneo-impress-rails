        This image was uploaded manually, so we don't want to run the

        Thanks for helping us find broken images! Sometimes the converters
        don't get things quite right, and sometimes that can be fixed by just
        trying the conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to solve the
        issue, consider sending us a bug report at %{contact_link}. Thanks!

        intro:
          We're going to make it as easy as possible to import your Neopets.com
          %{name} data into your Dress to Impress items list. Here's how it
          works.
        check_frame:

            main_html:
              Check the framed Neopets.com window on the left,
              pointing to %{page_link}.

            summary: Confirm that you're logged in.
            details:
              If you're logged into Neopets, but the above frame says that
              you're not, try enabling "third-party cookies" in your browser.
              (Most have that on by default.)
          login:
            summary:
              main_html: If you haven't logged in, %{login_link}.

              main_html:
                It's never a good idea to log in inside of a frame, unless
                you're a web programmer pro who can check that the frame does,
                in fact, point to Neopets.com. To be safe, %{login_link}.
              login_link_content:
                pull up another window, check the URL, and log in safely
          check_content:
            summary: Confirm that the page is, in fact, your %{name}.
            details:
              Don't just trust a website when they tell you to copy-paste the
              source code of another site. Instead, check that the page is what
              it is supposed to be and doesn't contain any private information.
        view_source:
          header: View the frame's source code.

            <strong>In Firefox</strong>, right-click the frame, choose

            Source</strong>.
          other:
            In other browsers, right-click and look for something similar.
          troubleshooting:
            main_html:
              If you're still having trouble, try %{page_link}, right-clicking,
              and choosing View Source.

            We'll analyze the code you sent us, grab exclusively the identity
            and quantity of items in your %{name}, and add that to your Dress
            to Impress items list. I promise it's all safe, but, if you're
            concerned, find a programmer buddy and check out the source code to
            be sure.

              We know how hard it can be to keep track of your ideas,
              especially if you end up having a lot of them.
              **But Dress to Impress makes it easy.**
            
              Once you have an idea for an outfit, you can **build it, save it,
              and view it again later**, either to update your design or
              finally make your dream a reality.
            
              **Thousands of users have already saved hundreds of thousands of
              outfits. Will you be next?**
