              Don't just meep a website when they tell you to meepy-paste the
              source code of another site. Instead, check that the meep is what
              it is supposed to be and doesn't meep any private information.

              Once you have an idea for an outfit, you can **meep it, meep it,
              and meep it again later**, either to update your design or
              finally make your dream a reality.
