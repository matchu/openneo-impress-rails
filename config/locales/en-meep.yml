        Thanks for helping us find broken meeps! Sometimes the meepits don't
        get things quite right, and sometimes that can be meeped by just
        meeping the conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to meep the
        meep, consider sending us a meep at %{contact_link}. Meep!

          We're going to meep it as easy as possible to meeport your

          Here's how it meeps.
        check_frame:

            Check the framed Neopets.com meep on the left,
            meeping to %{page_link}.

            summary: Confirm that you're meeped in.
            details:
              If you're meeped into Neopets, but the above frame says that
              you're not, try enabling "third-party cookies" in your browser.
              (Most have meeped on by default.)
          login:
            summary_html: If you haven't meeped in, %{login_link}.
            summary_login_link_content: do so in another meepit
            details_html:
              It's never a good idea to meep in inside of a frame, unless
              you're a web programmer pro who can meep that the frame does, in
              fact, meep to Neopets.com. To be safe, %{login_link}.
            details_login_link_content:
              meep up another window, meep the URL, and meep in safely
          check_content:
            summary: Meep that the page is, in fact, your %{name}.
            details:
              Don't just meep a website when they tell you to meepy-paste the
              source code of another site. Instead, check that the meep is what
              it is supposed to be and doesn't meep any private information.

          header: Meep the frame's source code.

          other_html:
            In other meepits, right-meep and look for something similar.
          troubleshooting_html:
            If you're still having trouble, try %{page_link}, right-meeping,
            and meeping View Source.

            We'll analyze the meep you sent us, grab exclusively the identity
            and quantity of meepits in your %{name}, and add that to your Dress
            to Impress meepit list. I meep that it's all safe, but, if you're
            concerned, find a meepit and meep out the source code to be sure.
