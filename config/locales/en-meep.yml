      explanation_html:
        Thanks for helping us find broken meeps! Sometimes the meepits don't
        get things quite right, and sometimes that can be meeped by just
        meeping the conversion again. If reconversion doesn't seem to meep the
        meep, consider sending us a meep at %{contact_link}. Meep!
      call_to_action:
        Which of these meeps looked meeped? We'll put it in line for remeeping.
