An extension of Dress to Impress (PHP) that runs on Ruby on Rails.
I wanted to use Rails initially for Impress, but hoped that using
PHP would allow me to attract more developers. Looks like that
wasn't the case, so I just went with what I loved and made the
items database in Rails.

Future Impress sections will likely find themselves in this
project, rather than the PHP project.
